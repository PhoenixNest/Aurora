### Experimental project

#### Welcome Fork and provide Bug list. Aurora promises not to disclose your personal privacy. The project uses the [AMap open platform](https://lbs.amap.com/) SDK, open Api in [HeFeng Weather](https://dev.heweather.com/) and open Api in [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/zh/service/about/api/). This project provides experience apk ([trial_debug.apk](https://github.com/PhoenixNest/Aurora/blob/master/trial_debug.apk) in the root directory), you can experience the effect by yourself.The project architecture is Google JetPack. The performance of multithreaded processing and background data feedback processing is not ideal for the time being, which will be updated periodically to solve the problem in the future.This project will automatically accompany LeakCanary to detect memory leaks. At present, this project has perfected the known memory leaks during development as much as possible. If you encounter any new memory leaks during testing, please feedback.
